Applications: inspection, navigation, object identification, visualisation and animation.
cultural heritage digital archiving. The motivations are different: documentation in case of loss or damage, 
virtual tourism and museum, education resources, interaction without risk of damage, and so forth. 
The requirements specified for many applications, including digital archiving and mapping



Paper 1: Image-based 3D Modelling: A Review, 2006, General Review of image-based 3D modelling


Paper 2: 3D Model Acquisition from Extended Image Sequences, 2005

Approach: 3-image matching scheme and six and seven point robust schemes



Paper 3: 3D Pose Estimation and 3D Model Retrieval for Objects in the Wild, 2018

Approach: CNN to predict the 2D projections of the objectâ€™s 3D bounding box corners (red dots). From these, we recover the object
pose using a PnP algorithm. Second row: We render depth images from 3D models under the estimated pose and extract
image descriptors from the real RGB image and the synthetic depth images using two different CNNs. Finally, we match the
computed descriptors to retrieve the closest 3D model. Our approach supports pre-computed synthetic descriptors.

model used: CNN to predict the boundaries and PnP to construct the boundaries

Approach: Model-based tracking

Accuracy:  We obtain an accuracy of
less that 0.7 mm in translation and 0.17 in rotation,
while the object is located at 40 cm from the camera. The
mean error is less than 0.2 pixels with a standard
deviation of 0.3 pixels.


Paper 5: Image-based 3D reconstruction using traditional and UAV datasets for
analysis of road pavement distress

Approach: Structure from Motion (SfM) is an innovative photogrammetry technique which allows any user 
to create 3D models from a photo data set; its current application in the road pavement domain is 
limited, as it is mostly used for architectural and archeological studies

SFM was the approach used and no machine learning was involved to reconstruct the images into 3d-models
